## Game-Play
* This is a classic memory game. Clicking/tapping a tile will reveal what symbol is on the other side.
* The goal is select 2 tiles at a time that have matching symbols
* If the symbols match, the tiles will remain face-up, if they are not a match, they will revert to their original position.
* Once all 16 tiles are matched, you have won the game and will be presented with the opportunity to play again or cancel.
* If you select the "Replay" option, the tiles will shuffle and your score will reset. 

**Try and beat the game with the fewest number of moves possible for a higher score**
